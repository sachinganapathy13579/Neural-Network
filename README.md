# Neural-Network

## 1) Predicting the burned area of forest using Neural Networks.

## 2) Predicting turbine energy yield (TEY) using Neural Networks.

      The dataset contains 11 sensor measures aggregated over one hour (by means of average or sum) from a gas turbine. 
      The Dataset includes gas turbine parameters (such as Turbine Inlet Temperature and Compressor Discharge pressure) in addition to the ambient variables.

      Attribute Information:

        * Ambient temperature (AT) 
        * Ambient pressure (AP) 
        * Ambient humidity (AH) 
        * Air filter difference pressure (AFDP) 
        * Gas turbine exhaust pressure (GTEP) 
        * Turbine inlet temperature (TIT) 
        * Turbine after temperature (TAT) 
        * Compressor discharge pressure (CDP) 
        * Turbine energy yield (TEY)
        * Carbon monoxide (CO) 
        * Nitrogen oxides (NOx)
